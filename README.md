Analysis of seagrass recovery for the Seagrass Resilience Experiment at the Virginia Coast Reserve LTER.

Motivation: Climate change is impacting the VCR through sea-level rise, increased storms, and warming water temperatures. Heatwaves are a component of the warming phenomena and have been shown to negatively impact seagrass within the VCR. My research at the VCR investigates seagrass resilience (i.e., recovery) following disturbance.

Context: A marine heatwave (MHW) in June 2015 led to a ~90% dieback of seagrass within the central portion of the South Bay, VA seagrass meadow. Spatial patterns in eelgrass shoot density loss were not uniform as the meadow edge nearest the oceanic inlet had no evidence of shoot density or canopy cover loss. Recovery of the meadow interior, as indicated by aerial canopy cover imagery and annual summer shoot density counts, was complete 3-4 years following the MHW disturbance.

Objectives: This study seeks to address 1) is resilience greater (i.e., faster recovery) at sites with greater oceanic exchange (i.e., meadow edge) that have lower thermal stress? 2) what are the mechanisms of recovery (i.e., clonal or seedling growth)? and 3) what is the shape of recovery (i.e., linear or non-linear)?

Approach: In June 2020 I initiated the worldâ€™s largest experimental disturbance of a seagrass ecosystem by removing above-ground seagrass in replicated, circular plots (6 meters in diameter) within the central and northern edge portions of the South Bay seagrass meadow.
